### PyBank

In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. You will be given two sets of revenue data (budget_data_1.csv and budget_data_2.csv). Each dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Revenue. 

Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset
* The total amount of revenue gained over the entire period
* The average change in revenue between months over the entire period
* The greatest increase in revenue (date and amount) over the entire period
* The greatest decrease in revenue (date and amount) over the entire period

Your final script must be able to handle any such similarly structured dataset in the future. In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

### PyPoll
In this challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. 

You will be given two sets of poll data (election_data_1.csv and election_data_2.csv). Each dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

* The total number of votes cast
* A complete list of candidates who received votes
* The percentage of votes each candidate won
* The total number of votes each candidate won
* The winner of the election based on popular vote.

Your final script must be able to handle any such similarly-structured dataset in the future. In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
